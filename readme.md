# MERN Password Manager: Backend Code Explanation (Textbook Style)

---

## 1. Data Model Design with MongoDB and Mongoose

### 1.1 User Schema (`user.js`)

```js
const userschema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  passwordHash: { type: String, required: true }
});
```

#### Explanation:

This defines the schema for users in the application.

* `username`: The name used by the user in the application. Required.
* `email`: Used for identification and login. Must be unique to prevent duplicate accounts. Required.
* `passwordHash`: The hashed password of the user. This is not the plain password. Required.

**Security Note**: Passwords are hashed before storage using `bcrypt`. Hashing is a one-way cryptographic transformation that ensures even if the database is compromised, original passwords cannot be easily retrieved.

---

### 1.2 Password Schema (`password.js`)

```js
const passwordschema = new mongoose.Schema({
  site: { type: String, required: true },
  userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "user" },
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});
```

#### Explanation:

This schema models each saved password entry.

* `site`: The name of the website (e.g., "github.com").
* `userId`: A reference to the user who owns this password record. This creates a manual relationship similar to a foreign key in relational databases.
* `username`: The username used for the site.
* `password`: The password used for the site. Currently stored in plaintext (this could be encrypted for improved security).

### Understanding Foreign Keys in MongoDB

In relational databases, a **foreign key** is a column that references the primary key of another table to establish a link between two tables. MongoDB, being a NoSQL document database, does not natively enforce such constraints.

In Mongoose, we replicate foreign key-like behavior using references. In the above schema:

```js
userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "user" }
```

This creates a reference to a document in the `user` collection. This is logically equivalent to a foreign key but is not enforced by the database engine. The `ref` keyword allows Mongoose to populate related user data when necessary.

This setup forms a **one-to-many relationship**: one user can have many password entries, but each password entry belongs to exactly one user.

---

## 2. Authentication Logic (`auth.js`)

### POST `/signup`

Registers a new user.

```js
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
const newuser = new user({ username, email, passwordHash });
await newuser.save();
```

* Checks if the email already exists in the database.
* Hashes the plain password using `bcrypt` (10 rounds of salting and hashing).
* Saves the new user.

---

### POST `/login`

Authenticates a user.

```js
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, exist.passwordHash);
const token = jwt.sign(
  { _id: exist._id, username: exist.username, email: exist.email },
  JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: "24h" }
);
```

* Retrieves the user by email.
* Compares the given password with the stored hash using `bcrypt.compare`.
* If matched, issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) valid for 24 hours.
* The token is signed with a secret key from environment variables.

JWTs are stateless tokens that carry user data in an encrypted and signed format, allowing the server to verify identity without storing session data.

---

## 3. Password Management Logic (`manage.js`)

### Middleware: `verifyToken`

```js
const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
req.user = decoded;
```

* Extracts the token from the `Authorization` header.
* Verifies the token's signature and expiration.
* Attaches the decoded user data to the `req` object.

This middleware is applied to all routes that require authentication.

---

### POST `/manage`

Saves a new password entry.

```js
const newdata = new Password({
  site,
  userId: req.user._id,
  username,
  password,
});
await newdata.save();
```

* Receives `site`, `username`, and `password` from the request.
* Links the new entry to the currently authenticated user using `req.user._id`.
* Saves it to the database.

---

### GET `/retrive`

Fetches all password entries for the authenticated user.

```js
const data = await Password.find({ userId });
```

* Queries the `password` collection for all entries where `userId` matches the current user.
* Returns the list of saved credentials.

---

### DELETE `/manage/:id`

Deletes a specific password entry.

```js
const entry = await Password.findOne({ _id: id, userId });
if (!entry) return res.status(404).json({ message: "Not found or unauthorized" });
await Password.findByIdAndDelete(id);
```

* Validates that the entry exists and belongs to the authenticated user.
* If valid, deletes the entry.

This prevents users from deleting other users' data by manipulating the ID.

---

## 4. Server Initialization (`index.js`)

```js
mongoose.connect(process.env.mongo_url)
```

* Connects to MongoDB using the connection string from `.env`.

```js
app.use("/api/auth", authroute)
app.use("/api/", Manageroute)
```

* Mounts the authentication routes under `/api/auth`
* Mounts the password management routes under `/api/`

Here is the **textual explanation** of the two illustrated concepts in your diagrams:

---

## üîπ 1. `CORS Configuration` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

### ‚ùñ Purpose:

CORS is a security mechanism implemented in browsers to restrict how resources on a web page can be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

In your app, the frontend (usually served from `localhost:5173`) tries to access the backend API (hosted at `localhost:3000`). Because these are different origins (port difference), the browser enforces CORS rules.

### ‚ùñ Code:

```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true); // Allow request
    } else {
      callback(new Error("Not allowed by CORS")); // Block request
    }
  },
  credentials: true,
}));
```

### ‚ùñ Explanation:

* **`allowedOrigins`**: An array of frontend URLs that are allowed to make requests to your backend.
* **`origin`**: The actual origin of the incoming HTTP request (automatically detected).
* **`credentials: true`**: Allows cookies and authorization headers (like JWT) to be sent with requests.

### ‚ùñ Flow:

1. Browser checks the origin (`localhost:5173`) of the request.
2. If the origin matches one in `allowedOrigins`, the request is accepted.
3. If it does not match, the request is blocked due to security policies.

### ‚ùñ Visual Summary (from Diagram):

* A browser sends a request from `http://localhost:5173`.
* Backend checks if this origin is in the allowed list.
* If yes: ‚úÖ request accepted.
* If not: ‚ùå request blocked with "CORS Error".

## üîπ 2. Understanding Foreign Keys in MongoDB

### ‚ùñ What is a Foreign Key (RDBMS Perspective)?

In relational databases:

* A **foreign key** is a column that points to the **primary key** in another table.
* It is used to **maintain referential integrity** between two tables.

Example:

* A `passwords` table might have a `user_id` column referencing the `id` column in the `users` table.

### ‚ùñ MongoDB & Mongoose Perspective:

MongoDB is a **NoSQL** document-based database. It does **not support foreign keys natively** like SQL. But using **Mongoose**, we simulate this via references:

```js
userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "user" }
```

* `ObjectId`: MongoDB's unique identifier for each document.
* `ref: "user"`: Tells Mongoose that this ID refers to a document in the `user` collection.

### ‚ùñ One-to-Many Relationship:

* One **User** can have many **Password** entries.
* Each **Password** entry belongs to **one User**.

This forms a **logical one-to-many relationship**.

### ‚ùñ Visual Summary (from Diagram):

* Two MongoDB collections: `user` and `password`.
* The `password` document has a field `userId` that links it to a specific `_id` in the `user` collection.
* This creates a directional relationship ‚Üí each password points to its owner.

Let me know if you'd like a walk-through of **`populate()`** usage in Mongoose to fetch full user info from `userId`, or want to extend this concept to embedded documents instead of references.

| Routes     | Define API endpoints and their logic           |
| Middleware | Handles authentication using JWTs              |
| Database   | Stores user and password data (MongoDB)        |
| Server     | Listens for requests, applies middleware       |
